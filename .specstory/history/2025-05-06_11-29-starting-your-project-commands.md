# Starting Your Project Commands (2025-05-06 13:29:24)

_**User**_

how to start this project

---

_**Assistant**_

To start this project, run one of these commands in your terminal:

For mobile:
```
npm run start
```

For web:
```
npm run start-web
```

For web with debugging:
```
npm run start-web-dev
```

These commands will start the Expo development server with tunneling enabled, which allows you to access the app on your physical device or in a web browser.

please check whats wrong

---

_**Assistant**_

There's a dependency conflict. Your project is trying to use React 19.0.0, but lucide-react-native version 0.507.0 requires React 16, 17, or 18.

You have two options to fix this:

1. Install with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Downgrade React to version 18 by updating your package.json:
   - Change "react": "19.0.0" to "react": "18.2.0"
   - Change "react-dom": "19.0.0" to "react-dom": "18.2.0"
   - Then run `npm install`

Option 2 (downgrading React) is recommended for better compatibility with your dependencies.

please fix this so i see the dashboard when logged in 

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to understand more about your app structure to fix the issue where you're not seeing the dashboard after login. Let me explore the codebase first.

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app • **19** results</summary>

| 📄 `+not-found.tsx` |
| 📄 `_layout.tsx` |
| 📁 `auth` |
| 📁 `(tabs)` |

</details>

---

Let me check the auth directory to understand the login flow:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/auth • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `login.tsx` |
| 📄 `register.tsx` |

</details>

---

Now let me check the tabs directory to understand what should be shown after login:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/tabs • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `_layout.tsx` |

</details>

---

Let me also check the (tabs) directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/(tabs) • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|

| 📄 `index.tsx` |
| 📄 `maintenance.tsx` |
| 📄 `reports.tsx` |
| 📄 `_layout.tsx` |
| 📄 `checklists.tsx` |

</details>

---

Now, let me check how routing is set up in the app's index file:

---

Read file: app/index.tsx

---

Let me check the auth store:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "auth-store.ts or auth-store.js" • **25** results</summary>

| `store/trip-log-store.ts` | L177-205 |
| `app/auth/login.tsx` | L135-173 |

</details>

---

Let me also check the tabs layout to understand the navigation structure:

---

Read file: app/tabs/_layout.tsx

---

Let me also check the (tabs) layout:

---

Read file: app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx

---

Based on my analysis and the logs provided in your screenshot, I've found the issue. Your app has dual tab layouts: one in `/app/tabs/_layout.tsx` and another in `/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, which is causing confusion in the routing.

According to the logs, the authentication process is working correctly, but there's a routing conflict:
1. After login, the app is checking `inAuthGroup` as `{ inAuthGroup: false, isAuthenticated: true, segments: ["tabs"] }`
2. It's then trying to redirect to `["tabs"]` but should use `["(tabs)"]` based on your folder structure

Let's fix the root `_layout.tsx` file to properly handle the redirection after login:

---

Read file: app/_layout.tsx

---

Now I will check the index.tsx in the main app:

---

Read file: app/splash.tsx

---

Now, I understand the issue. Based on the logs, your file structure, and code examination, I've identified the problem:

1. You have two tab layouts: `/app/tabs/_layout.tsx` and `/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
2. After authentication, the code is trying to navigate to `/tabs` but it should navigate to `/(tabs)`
3. The routing conflict appears in both `app/_layout.tsx` and `app/index.tsx` which are directing to `/tabs` instead of `/(tabs)`

Here's the fix:

---

```diff
      if (!isInitialized) return;
  
-     const inAuthGroup = segments[0] === '(tabs)' || segments[0] === 'tabs';
+     const inAuthGroup = segments[0] === '(tabs)';
      const inAuthScreens = segments[0] === 'auth';
      const inPublicScreens = segments[0] === 'splash' || segments[0] === 'welcome';
```

```diff
        if (isAuthenticated && (inAuthScreens || inPublicScreens)) {
          // Redirect to the main app if user is authenticated but on auth or public screens
-         router.replace('/tabs');
+         router.replace('/(tabs)');
        } else if (!isAuthenticated && inAuthGroup) {
          // Redirect to splash if user is not authenticated but trying to access protected routes
```

---

Now let's update the index.tsx file to use the correct path:

---

```diff
            // Use setTimeout to ensure this happens after layout is mounted
            setTimeout(() => {
-             router.replace('/tabs');
+             router.replace('/(tabs)');
            }, 0);
          } else {
```

---

The type errors are related to style typing. Let's ignore those for now as they're not related to the navigation issue.

Let's also update the splash screen to use the correct path:

---

```diff
      if (isAuthenticated) {
        // If user is already authenticated, redirect to main app
-       router.replace('/tabs');
+       router.replace('/(tabs)');
      }
    }, [isAuthenticated, router]);
```

---

Now let's update the login page to redirect to the correct path after login:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "router.replace in login.tsx" • **25** results</summary>
        
| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `app/index.tsx` | L1-11 |
| `app/auth/login.tsx` | L1-44 |
| `app/auth/login.tsx` | L44-107 |
| `app/index.tsx` | L11-64 |

| `app/+not-found.tsx` | L1-17 |
| `app/auth/login.tsx` | L441-459 |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | L40-77 |

</details>

---

Let's update the login function in the Login screen:

---

Read file: app/auth/login.tsx

---

Let's update the login redirect in the login screen:

---

```diff
        
        // If login is successful, navigate to the main app
-       router.replace('/tabs');
+       router.replace('/(tabs)');
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Login error:", err);
```

---

Let's check to see if we need to update another place by searching for use of '/tabs' elsewhere in auth files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "router\.replace\(\'/tabs\'\)" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/amandanordqvisted/vst/app/auth/register.tsx` | L51 | `router.replace('/tabs');` |

</details>

---

Let's also update the register page:

---

```diff
        await register(name, email, password);
        // If registration is successful, navigate to the main app
-       router.replace('/tabs');
+       router.replace('/(tabs)');
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Registration error:", err);
```

---

There are a lot of TypeScript errors related to React Native styling, but those are unrelated to our navigation issue. Now let's make sure that there's no issue with the duplicate tabs folder.

Let's look at what's in the tabs directory to decide if we need to keep it:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/tabs • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `_layout.tsx` |

</details>

---

The `tabs` directory only has a layout file which duplicates the one in `(tabs)`. Let's check if it is referenced anywhere important:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "tabs/_layout" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let's check if we need to delete the duplicate tabs folder:

---

Removing the duplicate tabs layout file to avoid routing confusion

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/tabs • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

```bash
rmdir app/tabs
```

```
amandanordqvisted@Amandas-MacBook-Air vst % 

```

---

Now let's also update RootLayout's Stack navigation configuration to ensure that the `(tabs)` route is properly recognized:

---

```diff
                <Stack.Screen name="auth/login" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
                <Stack.Screen name="auth/register" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
-               <Stack.Screen name="tabs" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
                <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
              </Stack>
```

---

Let's run the app now to see if the fix worked:

---

Cancelled
